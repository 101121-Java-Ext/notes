String
	- reference type, array of characters
	- String is a class, the strings that we're working with are instances of that class
	- immutable - cannot be changed, value of a string remains the same (final keyword)
	- Strings are usually stored in the String pool (in the heap)
		- where all strings instantiated literally (ie: String s = "Hello";) are stored
		- this allows Java to reuse the save String for repeated valued strings
	- String newS = new String("Hello"); //Creates the string in the heap itself instead of in the String Pool
	- String s = "Hello"; //Creates the string in the String Pool, can be reused
	- interning
		- .intern() method - checks if a String is already in the String Pool and if it exists returns a reference to it,
			else creates that string and returns that reference

StringBuilder/ StringBuffer
	- mutable alternatives to Strings with methods that allow for manipulation
		- append, replace...
	- StringBuilder is not thread-safe - faster
	- StringBuffer is thread-safe - slower

Scanner
	- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
	- Class in java that can be used to "scan" through several things
		- files, console inputs, input streams
	- can parse through inputs for different types, read an entire line... etc.
	- Recommendation: use one scanner per input stream 
	- Good practice: close resources when no longer needed
