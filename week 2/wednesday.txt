Inheritance
	- subclasses/children classes adopting states and behaviors from a parent/super class
	- deriving classes allows for code reusability and more efficient development
		- DRY - Do not repeat yourself - principle
	- keyword "extends"
		- by default/implicitely every class extends the Object class
	- by default the first line of every constructor is a call the the parent's constructor (super())
		- super is a keyword that refers to the parent class
			- can access states and behaviors from the parent class dependending on the access modifer
		- this vs super
		- this - refers to the current instance
		- super - refers to the parent
