JDBC
	- Java Database Connectivity
		- establish a connection between a Java application and a database
			- dependency is database specific
	- Important JDBC classes/interfaces
		- DriverManager (C)
			- manage the JDBC driver
			- .getConnection()
				- provide a connection to the db
					- hardcoded (bad practice)
					- property file (prevent from pushing to GitHub using .gitignore)
					- environment variables
		- Connection (I)
			- represents the connection to the database
			- .setAutoCommit(boolean)
			- createStatement()/PreparedStatement()
			- commit()/rollback()
			- close()
		- Statement (I)
			- represents a SQL statement
			- .executeQuery(sql)
			- vulnerable to SQL injection
				- best used when no user input is required
		- PreparedStatement (I)
			- represents a SQL statement
				- that has been pre-processed and therefore prevents SQL injections
			- have to setFields for user inputs
		- ResultSet
			- result of a Query
	- SQL Injection
		- placing malicious code into a sql statement
			- ie: "select * from employees where = [userInput];
				- input could be "0; drop table employees;"
