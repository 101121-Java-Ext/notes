- Meet with at two of your batchmates.
	- 1 interviewer
		- The interviewer's responsibility is to ask 3-4 questions to the interviewee from different sections of the curriculum
			- An interview focus can be provided by the interviewee (ie Focus on Threads)
	- 1 interviewee
		- The interviewee's responsibility is to answer the questions to the best of their ability, if a question is unknown practice answering as you would in an interview setting
	- 1 scribe
		- The scribe's responsibility is to take notes of the question asked and the answer provided by the interviewee in additional to any notes relevant to softskills 

Example format:

	Interviewer: Name
	Interviewee: Name
	Scribe: Name

	Question || Note ||Answered properly (1pt):
	ie:
	What is Java?
	- Java is... eh *redacted*... an OOP language.
	  Interviewee sounds unsure of his answer, curses a lot

- Conduct practice interviews with one another for each of the 3 members and take turns playing each role
- At the end of each interview review the questions asked and discuss/research as needed
- Feel free to provide constructive criticism but do so in a professional manner
- Once all of the interviews are completed, push the notes taken for each individual to the common repository.
